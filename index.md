<h1 style="text-align:center;">Catch per unit effort data standardisation in R for fisheries biologists and practitioners </h1>

![course_image](./images/course_image.png)


This short course is aimed at introducing researchers to fisheries data analysis using linear models (LM), general linear models (GLM) and general linear mixed models (GLMM) in the R working environment. The sessions will be a blend of interactive demonstrations, lectures and Q&A sessions. Prior to the course, attendees will receive R script, example datasets and a list of R packages to install.

By the end of the course, participants should be able to
Undertake data exploration to avoid common pitfalls in tackling a data analysis
Recognise data structures and fit appropriate models to CPUE data
Understand and apply alternative approaches to model selection
Interpret and present the results of statistical models

The course is led by Carl Smith (Nature Research Centre, Lithuania and University of Lodz, Poland) with an extensive expertise in statistical analyses and teaching. Additional teaching support is provided by Asta Audzijonyte (Nature Research Centre, Lithuania & University of Tasmania, Australia) and Egle Jakubavičiūtė (Nature Research Centre, Lithuania).

## Online meetings

In this course, it is expected that participants will mostly learn independently, but we will have three online meetings to go through the materials, ask questions and for general discussion. 

These meetings will be recorded and videos will be available (below) immediately after the meeting.
