<h1 style="text-align:center;">Catch per unit effort data standardisation in R for fisheries biologists and practitioners </h1>

![course_image](./images/course_image.png)


This short course is aimed at introducing researchers to fisheries data analysis using linear models (LM), general linear models (GLM) and general linear mixed models (GLMM) in the R working environment. The sessions will be a blend of interactive demonstrations, lectures and Q&A sessions. Prior to the course, attendees will receive R script, example datasets and a list of R packages to install.

By the end of the course, participants should be able to
Undertake data exploration to avoid common pitfalls in tackling a data analysis
Recognise data structures and fit appropriate models to CPUE data
Understand and apply alternative approaches to model selection
Interpret and present the results of statistical models

The course is led by Carl Smith (Nature Research Centre, Lithuania and University of Lodz, Poland) with an extensive expertise in statistical analyses and teaching. Additional teaching support is provided by Asta Audzijonyte (Nature Research Centre, Lithuania & University of Tasmania, Australia) and Egle Jakubavičiūtė (Nature Research Centre, Lithuania).

## Course content


Lesson 1. [Introduction](1-introduction.md)


<br/>

## Programming skills and Python

It will be useful if course participants have basic programming experience, in Python or R. The scripts used in the course are written in Python, but they are adapted to be user friendly and do not require prior Python knowledge to run them (you would naturally need Python knowledge to modify these scripts further). If you want to learn more about coding with Python a few useful tutorials of basic operations can be found [here](https://www.learnpython.org/). You can also find a list of books [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntroductoryBooks).

## Bring your own images

We will provide an example dataset for the course. This dataset includes 50 images per species which were provided by [MyCatch](https://mycatch.ca/) and [Fishial](https://fishial.ai/).
It would be very interesting and exciting if course participants also bring their own datasets of fish images. We would need a minimum of 50 images per species and you can use as few as 2 species to start with (however, if species are very similar morphologically, we might need more than 50 images per species). Of course, you want to make sure that fish species in your dataset are identified correctly, otherwise your model will not be very useful (you might have heard the expression "garbage in - garbage out"). Finally, for the tutorials we will use Google drive so please upload your own images to your Google drive by species (i.e. one species per folder).

## Online meetings

In this course, it is expected that participants will mostly learn independently, but we will have three online meetings to go through the materials, ask questions and for general discussion. 

These meetings will be recorded and videos will be available (below) immediately after the meeting.
