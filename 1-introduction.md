# Introduction

In this section, participants will find information on course contents, requirements and resources.

The workshop will start on Wednesday 23rd November and will run from 1000-1700 Central European Time.

You will need to install the latest version of R and RStudio. To install the R software on your computer go to: https://www.r-project.org and follow the instructions for downloading the latest version.

To install RStudio go to https://rstudio.com and download ‘RStudio Desktop’ (the basic, free version). You will need to install the R software before installing RStudio.

Once both are installed always start any R session by opening RStudio (R will be opened automatically).

Finally, please run the [PackagesBayesWorkshop](PackagesCPUEworkshop_aa.R) file to ensure you have all the required packages for the workshop. This needs to be done before the workshop and will take about 30 minutes. If you have problems, please let us know.
