# Introduction

This course assumes basic knowledge of statistics and programming in R.

To make sure you can run all the code smoothly you will need to update
your R and Rstudio to the latest version (at least 4.2 version of R). To
install the R software on your computer go to
<https://www.r-project.org> and follow the instructions for downloading
the latest version. Depending on how you update your R, you might need
to update your R packages.

To install RStudio go to <https://rstudio.com> and download 'RStudio
Desktop' (the basic, free version). You will need to install the R
software before installing RStudio. Once both are installed always start
any R session by opening RStudio (R will be opened automatically).

It is very important that you install all the required packages before
the course and make sure they all work. To do that, please download and
run the [**PackagesCPUEWorkshop**](PackagesCPUEworkshop.R) file. This should
be done before the workshop and will take at least 30 minutes or more,
depending on your internet connection speed.

If you are having problems with installing packages or running R
scripts, please post them into this [discussion
group](https://github.com/fishsizeproject/CPUEcourse/discussions/1) on
the course GitHub page. We encourage all course participants to help
each other and share their solutions.
